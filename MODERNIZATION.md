# Chromeless Modernization Plan

This document outlines the plan for modernizing the Chromeless application to use current technologies and best practices.

## Completed Items

- ✅ Update Node.js from v16 to v18+
- ✅ Update Electron from v16 to v28
- ✅ Migrate from React 16 to React 18
- ✅ Upgrade from Material-UI v4 to MUI v5
- ✅ Integrate Redux Toolkit for state management
- ✅ Update webpack from v4 to v5
- ✅ Add testing infrastructure with Jest
- ✅ Update browser engine support for modern browsers
- ✅ Create migration guide for developers
- ✅ Implement React.memo and useMemo for performance optimization
- ✅ Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- ✅ Update browser detection logic to handle new browser versions
- ✅ Update Electron security model with contextBridge

## Current Phase: Phase 5 - Final Polishing

### Progress
- ✅ Update browser detection logic to handle new browser versions
  - Added support for Arc Browser
  - Added support for Opera GX and Opera One
  - Added support for Firefox Developer Edition and Firefox Nightly
  - Updated Firefox to no longer be marked as experimental
  - Prepared infrastructure for new browser icons
- ✅ Updated Electron security model
  - Replaced direct exposure of IPC with contextBridge
  - Updated window security settings (contextIsolation: true, nodeIntegration: false)
  - Implemented proper preload script patterns
  - Updated renderer code to use secure contextBridge API
- ✅ Bug fixes
  - Fixed compatibility issues with Electron 28
  - Updated getStaticGlobal helper for contextBridge compatibility
  - Updated IPC communication patterns for security
  - Added proper error handling for missing API access

### Remaining Tasks in Phase 5
- ✅ Convert synchronous IPC methods to asynchronous
  - Implemented async versions of all IPC methods using invoke/handle pattern
  - Added proper error handling for async methods
  - Maintained backward compatibility with deprecated warnings
  - Added documentation for new async pattern usage
- ✅ Complete documentation updates with new features
  - Added README-UPDATES.md with comprehensive release notes
  - Added src/README.md with IPC communication documentation
  - Updated MODERNIZATION.md with progress information
- ✅ Prepare for release with version bump to 5.0.0
  - Version already updated in package.json to 5.0.0

## Complete: Phase 5 - Final Polishing ✅

All planned tasks for Phase 5 have been completed. The application is now ready to enter Phase 6 (Release Preparation).

## Next: Phase 6 - Release Preparation
- ✅ Update application version to 5.0.0 (already done in package.json)
- ✅ Create comprehensive release notes (README-UPDATES.md)
- [ ] Prepare installers for all platforms
- [ ] Create update mechanism for existing users
- [ ] Conduct final testing on all supported platforms
- [ ] Create release tags in git repository

## Testing Guidelines
- Run Jest tests: `npm test`
- Check browser integration on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- Verify installation of applications using all supported browsers
- Test keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
- Verify proper dark mode support

## Security Improvements
- All preload scripts now use contextBridge for secure IPC communication
- No direct Node.js exposure to renderer processes
- Modern Electron security model with contextIsolation enabled
- Safer remote access through limited API exposure

## Remaining Known Issues
- Custom browser icons need to be created and implemented
- Complete documentation updates
- E2E testing infrastructure
- Update component usages to use the new async methods throughout the codebase
