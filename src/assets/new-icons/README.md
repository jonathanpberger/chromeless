# Browser Icons

This directory contains placeholder for new browser icons that need to be added:

1. Arc Browser - Arc.app icon (`arc.png`)
2. Firefox Developer Edition (`firefox-developer.png`)
3. Firefox Nightly (`firefox-nightly.png`)
4. Opera GX (`opera-gx.png`)
5. Opera One (`opera-one.png`)

## Instructions for adding icons

1. Download the official icons from each browser's website or press kit
2. Resize them to match the existing icons (approximately 128x128px PNG format)
3. Place them in the main assets directory
4. Update the imports in `src/constants/engines.js` to use the new icons

When adding the icons, make sure to:
- Use transparent backgrounds when possible
- Match the style and quality of the existing icons
- Ensure the icons are properly licensed for use in the application
